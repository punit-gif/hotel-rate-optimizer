**Flow**

1. **ETL** loads `/sample_data/*.csv` and `/inbox/nightly.csv` (if present) and upserts into Postgres (UTC).
2. **ML** builds features, trains a LightGBM model (fallback: Prophet-style moving avg), and writes 14â€‘day forecasts to `forecasts` with recommended ADR via pricing rules.
3. **FastAPI** exposes auth, forecast query, brief generation/sending, and an ETL trigger endpoint.
4. **Streamlit** lets the GM login, view charts/tables, and send the Daily Rate Brief.
5. **Notifier** can run as a cron/APScheduler job to hit `/brief?send=true` daily at 07:00 America/Chicago.
